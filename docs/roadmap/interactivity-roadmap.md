# Interactivity Roadmap

## Current (v1)

Hybrid rollout:

- Option A: non-interactive exercises for all chapters
- Option C: Pyodide in-browser runner for selected popular chapters

## Next (v1.1)

Expand Option C to additional chapters using engagement data.

## Future (v2)

Option C by default for high-value tutorial chapters; keep Option A as fallback.

## Suggested rollout

1. Track top 10 chapters by traffic.
2. Add or remove Pyodide blocks based on usage and performance.
3. Keep complex exercises in separate files for future reuse.
4. Expand only where engagement improves.
