# Getting Started

## What you'll learn

- How to run Python code
- Script vs interactive mode
- Basic program structure

## Explanation

Python can be used in an interactive REPL or by running `.py` files.
Use the REPL for fast experimentation and scripts for reusable programs.

## Example

Run it in the browser:

<div class="py-run" markdown="1">

```python
name = "Ada"
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

</div>

## Common mistakes

- Running code with a different Python version than expected
- Mixing tabs and spaces in indentation
