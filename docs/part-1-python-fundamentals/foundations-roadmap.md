# Foundations Roadmap (3-4 Months, Part-Time)

## Who this path is for

This roadmap is for complete beginners with zero programming experience.
It is designed for part-time study with an estimated total duration of 3-4 months.

## Recommended study rhythm

- 8-10 hours per week
- 4-5 study sessions per week (60-120 minutes each)
- 60% coding practice, 30% reading, 10% review
- Advance by mastery, not by fixed weekly deadlines

## Target outcomes by the end

You should be able to:

- Read and explain small Python programs confidently
- Write scripts with variables, conditions, loops, functions, and files
- Understand basic object-oriented code without confusion
- Debug common errors and test core behavior
- Continue into intermediate Python topics with a solid base

## Module-based plan

### Module 1: Computer and programming basics

Focus:

- What a computer is: CPU, RAM, disk, operating system
- How programs run: source code, interpreter, process, input/output
- Difference between memory (temporary) and disk (persistent)
- Why programming languages exist and where Python fits

Practice goals:

- Install and run Python locally
- Use terminal commands (`pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `python`)
- Run a simple script and explain each line

### Module 2: Python core language

Focus:

- Variables and names
- How assignment works in memory (names reference objects)
- Core data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `None`
- Expressions, operators, and type conversion
- String formatting and user input

Practice goals:

- Write 15-20 tiny scripts
- Predict output before running code
- Use `type()` and `id()` to inspect behavior

### Module 3: Control flow and reusable logic

Focus:

- `if`/`elif`/`else`
- Truthy/falsy values and boolean logic
- `for` and `while` loops
- Functions, parameters, return values, and scope

Practice goals:

- Build input-validation loops
- Split repeated logic into functions
- Refactor one script into cleaner functions

### Module 4: Files, errors, and modules

Focus:

- Reading and writing text files safely (`with open(...)`)
- Paths and folders with `pathlib`
- Exceptions (`try`/`except`) and error messages
- Organizing code with modules and imports

Practice goals:

- Create a script that reads a CSV-like text file and summarizes data
- Handle missing files or bad inputs gracefully
- Split a project into multiple `.py` files

### Module 5: OOP and project building

Focus:

- Classes and objects
- Attributes, methods, and encapsulation basics
- When to use classes vs functions
- Intro to testing with `pytest`

Practice goals:

- Build a small project (for example: habit tracker, expense tracker, or quiz app)
- Write 8-15 tests for key functions/methods
- Present the project with a short README

## Incremental module progression

1. Start with Module 1 and continue in order
2. Move to the next module only after completing practice goals in the current one
3. Add checkpoint mini-projects at major progress points
4. Finish with a final capstone project
5. Use the Curriculum Tracker for the detailed checkpoint cadence and module granularity

## Missing but important elements to include

Your list is strong. These additions are essential for solid foundations:

- Error handling and exceptions
- Debugging skills (reading tracebacks, using breakpoints, `print` debugging)
- Modules and imports (how Python files connect)
- Basic testing mindset (`pytest` fundamentals)
- Environment basics (virtual environments, dependencies)
- Problem-solving method (break a problem into steps before coding)
- Code style and readability (PEP 8, meaningful naming)
- Git fundamentals (save progress, compare changes, rollback safely)

## Suggested first milestone checks

After Module 2:

- You can explain RAM vs disk in plain words
- You can write scripts with input, variables, and type conversions
- You can explain why `input()` returns a string

After Module 3:

- You can solve small exercises with functions and loops
- You can debug common syntax and runtime errors

After Module 5:

- You can build a small Python project from scratch
- You can read intermediate tutorials and understand most examples
