# Variables and Types

## What you'll learn

- Dynamic typing basics
- Common built-in types
- Type conversion patterns

## Explanation

Python variables are names bound to objects. A single variable name can later refer
to a different type, but clarity improves when you keep type usage predictable.

## Example

Run it in the browser:

<div class="py-run" markdown="1">

```python
count = 3
price = 19.99
title = "Python Book"
print(type(count), type(price), type(title))
```

</div>

## Common mistakes

- Confusing `=` (assignment) with `==` (comparison)
- Forgetting that `input()` returns text

## Exercises
